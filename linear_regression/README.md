# Linear Regression

This folder contains my foundational work on linear regression.

The goal of this section is to:
- understand the intuition behind linear regression
- implement a basic regression model using Python and scikit-learn
- evaluate model performance using standard regression metrics

## Structure

- `notebooks/`  
  Contains the implementation and experimentation notebooks.

- `data/`  
  Contains dataset documentation. The actual dataset is excluded from the repository.

## Status

Completed basic linear regression implementation.
