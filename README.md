# Machine_Learning

This repository documents my structured learning path in machine learning, starting from foundational concepts and progressing toward applied, real-world projects.

The focus is on:
- data understanding and preprocessing
- exploratory data analysis
- implementing machine learning algorithms from fundamentals
- evaluating models using appropriate metrics

Each folder represents a specific concept or model, with clear separation between experiments, datasets, and documentation.

## Repository Structure

- `linear_regression/`  
  Foundational implementation and experiments with linear regression.

More models and projects will be added incrementally as part of this learning progression.

## Data Note

Large datasets are not included in this repository due to size constraints.  
Each model folder contains instructions on how to obtain and place the required data.
